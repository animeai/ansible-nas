Hydra2 is a meta search application for NZB indexers, the "spiritual successor" to NZBmegasearcH, and an evolution of the original application NZBHydra.

It provides easy access to a number of raw and newznab based indexers. 

## Usage
The web interface is by default at yourip:5076 or hydra.ansiblenasdomain.tld if you use traefik.

Use the web interface to set up indexers and connections to your nzb download applications.
