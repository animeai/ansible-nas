Homepage: ()

Photoshow is gallery software at its easiest, it doesn't even require a database.

## Usage
The web interface is by default avaliable at http://ansible-nas-ip-or-domain:12455. If you use traefik the default location is https://photoshow.ansiable-nas=domain.tld

On first run create an admin account, any folder and its subfolders that you map to /Pictures will be presented as a webgallery. Config settings are persistent and stored as a subfolder of the /Thumbs mapping.
